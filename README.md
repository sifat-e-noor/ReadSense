 # About ReadSense :
Millions of individuals worldwide have central visual impairment, a medical condition where the center field of their
vision is blurred. This creates challenges and produces difficulties when they read. To address this, a project ’Reading
the Reader’ aims to use Machine Learning models to interpret and adapt settings for optimal reading experience for
the user. A smaller component of the project ReadSense was
developed. 
ReadSense is a personalized reading experience
analyzer that can be used across various devices including
e-readers, tablet, and smartphones, and in different contexts
such as place, brightness and environment. It aims to anal-
yse user reading patterns and preferences through collecting
data points through logging interactions with the application.
The project underwent several low-fidelity iterations, user
testing through informal evaluations and an experiment, and
then was developed as a high-fidelity functional prototype.
